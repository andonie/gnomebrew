# Data Sources

Aspects of this software are build upon data publicly provided by others.
In this document, I'm referring to the external data sources that have been processed
and stored in an appropriate format in this `data` directory.

The disjointed efforts of many individuals have made the internet a rich source of data that can be used
in a myriad of ways, this game just being one of them. I'm grateful for these efforts and want to make sure that
at least all locations where data is sourced from directly are mentioned in here.
